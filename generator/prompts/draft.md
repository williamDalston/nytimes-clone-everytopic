**Perspective Context:**
{if perspective}This is perspective {perspective} of {totalPerspectives} on this topic. Maintain your unique lens/angle while building on the blueprint structure.{/if}

**Enhancement Requirements:**

1. **Historical Context**: Frame insights as a story of discovery, showing how concepts built upon each other
2. **Concrete Examples**: Replace abstract concepts with specific, vivid illustrations relevant to {topic}
3. **Expert Insights**: Integrate how practitioners in this field actually think and work
4. **Causal Chains**: Show how one breakthrough or insight led to the next
5. **Relevant Anecdotes**: Brief, illuminating stories that support key points

**CRITICAL QUALITY CONSTRAINTS:**

**Forbidden Phrases (STRICTLY AVOID):**
- "delve into," "it's important to note," "furthermore," "moreover," "additionally"
- "it's worth noting," "it's crucial that," "in conclusion," "to summarize"
- "as we can see," "it becomes clear," "various aspects," "numerous studies"
- "in today's world," "unlock the potential," "game-changer"
- "In this article, we will..." or any weak academic openings

**Required Writing Standards:**
1. **Specificity First**: Every claim must include specific examples, data points, or named sources. "A 2023 MIT study by Dr. Smith" not "studies show."
2. **Natural Voice**: Write as an expert explaining to a colleague—confident, warm, accessible. Use contractions naturally.
3. **Sentence Variety**: Mix sentence lengths and structures. Never repeat the same sentence beginning pattern.
4. **Active Voice**: 90% active voice. "Researchers discovered" not "It was discovered."
5. **Concrete Grounding**: Every theoretical concept must be grounded in a real-world application or example.
6. **Engaging Flow**: Each paragraph should flow naturally into the next. Read it aloud—does it sound human?

**Preservation Guidelines:**
- Maintain the existing structure and thesis from the blueprint
- Every idea from the blueprint must be present but deepened
- Add width, depth, and intellectual texture without losing focus
- Ground theoretical concepts in real-world applications
- Write in natural, human-like voice

**Content Structure:**
- Introduction (compelling hook + thesis—no "In this article" openings)
- 3-5 main sections with subheadings
- Conclusion with actionable takeaways or thought-provoking insights

**Output Format:**
HTML formatted article with proper paragraph tags, headings (h2, h3), lists (ul, ol), and emphasis (strong, em) where appropriate.

**Self-Check Before Output:**
- [ ] No forbidden phrases
- [ ] Every claim has specific backing
- [ ] Sentence variety maintained
- [ ] Natural, human voice throughout
- [ ] Opening hooks immediately
- [ ] Conclusion provides real value
