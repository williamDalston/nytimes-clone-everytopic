You are enhancing an article draft about "{topic}".

**Previous Content:**
{previousContent}

**Enhancement Tasks:**

1. **Depth & Detail**: Expand each section with more specific examples, data points, and insights
2. **Metaphors & Analogies**: Add 2-3 original analogies that make complex concepts immediately graspable (avoid clichés)
3. **Counter-Arguments**: Address the strongest counter-perspective to your main thesis fairly, then show how your argument withstands it
4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Connect {topic} to related fields or broader implications

**Quality Standards:**
- Don't summarize or condense—expand and enrich
- Each paragraph should advance the argument meaningfully
- Maintain intellectual sophistication while staying accessible
- Preserve all existing content—only add, never remove
- Natural flow between paragraphs

**Output:**
Enhanced HTML article (1200-1800 words) that builds upon the previous content.
