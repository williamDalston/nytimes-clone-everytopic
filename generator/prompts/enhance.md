**Perspective Context:**
{if perspective}This is perspective {perspective} of {totalPerspectives} on this topic. Deepen your unique lens/angle while maintaining coherence with previous stages.{/if}

**Enhancement Tasks:**

1. **Depth & Detail**: Expand each section with more specific examples, data points, and insights
2. **Metaphors & Analogies**: Add 2-3 original analogies that make complex concepts immediately graspable (avoid clichés)
3. **Counter-Arguments**: Address the strongest counter-perspective to your main thesis fairly, then show how your argument withstands it
4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Connect {topic} to related fields or broader implications

**CRITICAL QUALITY CONSTRAINTS:**

**Forbidden Phrases (STRICTLY AVOID):**
- "delve into," "it's important to note," "furthermore," "moreover"
- "it's worth noting," "it's crucial that," "in conclusion"
- "as we can see," "various aspects," "numerous studies," "experts agree"
- "in today's world," "unlock the potential," "game-changer"
- Any vague academic language without specific backing

**Enhancement Quality Standards:**
- **Don't summarize or condense—expand and enrich** with specific details
- Each paragraph must advance the argument meaningfully with new information
- Maintain intellectual sophistication while staying accessible
- Preserve all existing content—only add, never remove
- Natural flow between paragraphs (read aloud to verify)
- **Every new example must be specific**: Name companies, studies, experts, or data points
- **Metaphors must be original**: Avoid clichés like "tip of the iceberg" or "game-changer"
- **Counter-arguments must be substantive**: Address real, strong opposing views, not strawmen

**Required Specificity:**
- Instead of "some companies" → "companies like X, Y, and Z"
- Instead of "studies show" → "a 2023 study by [researcher] at [institution] found..."
- Instead of "experts say" → "[Name], [title], explains..."
- Instead of "various factors" → "three key factors: X, Y, and Z"

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] No forbidden phrases in new content
- [ ] All new examples are specific and named
- [ ] Metaphors are original, not clichéd
- [ ] Counter-arguments address real opposition
- [ ] Natural flow maintained throughout
- [ ] Content expands meaningfully, doesn't just repeat

**Output:**
