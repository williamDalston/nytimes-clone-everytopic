# Writing Quality Constraints

## CRITICAL: Quality Standards

**These constraints are MANDATORY and must be enforced in all generated content.**

### Forbidden AI Patterns (STRICTLY AVOID)

**Generic Transitions:**
- "delve into" / "delve deeper"
- "it's important to note" / "it is important to note"
- "furthermore" / "moreover" / "additionally"
- "it's worth noting" / "it is worth noting"
- "it's crucial that" / "it is crucial that"
- "in conclusion" / "to conclude"
- "in summary" / "to summarize"
- "as we can see" / "as we have seen"
- "it should be noted" / "it must be noted"
- "let's explore" / "let us explore"
- "it becomes clear" / "it is clear that"
- "one must consider" / "we must consider"
- "it is evident that" / "it becomes evident"
- "this highlights" / "this emphasizes"
- "it is essential to" / "it's essential to"

**Vague Academic Language:**
- "various aspects" / "various factors"
- "numerous studies" (without citing specific ones)
- "research suggests" (without specifics)
- "experts agree" (without naming experts)
- "many people believe" / "some argue"
- "it is widely known" / "it is well-known"
- "generally speaking" / "in general"
- "typically" / "usually" (when not backed by specifics)

**Overused Phrases:**
- "in today's world" / "in today's society"
- "in the modern era" / "in our modern world"
- "in an ever-changing world"
- "the landscape of" (overused metaphor)
- "unlock the potential" / "unlock the power"
- "harness the power" / "leverage the power"
- "game-changer" / "revolutionary" (unless truly warranted)
- "cutting-edge" / "state-of-the-art" (use sparingly)

**Weak Openings:**
- "In this article, we will..."
- "This article explores..."
- "The purpose of this article is..."
- "This piece will examine..."
- "We are going to look at..."

**Weak Conclusions:**
- "In conclusion, we have seen..."
- "To sum up..."
- "In summary..."
- "All in all..."
- "At the end of the day..."

### Required Writing Standards

**1. Clarity & Precision:**
- Every sentence must have a clear purpose
- Use specific examples, not vague generalizations
- Name sources, studies, or experts when making claims
- Quantify when possible ("3 out of 5 studies" not "many studies")
- Replace abstract concepts with concrete illustrations

**2. Natural Voice:**
- Write as if speaking to an intelligent colleague
- Use contractions naturally ("it's" not "it is" in casual contexts)
- Vary sentence length (mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones)
- Use active voice (90% of the time)
- Include occasional strategic sentence fragments for emphasis

**3. Sentence Variety:**
- Avoid starting 3+ consecutive sentences the same way
- Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences
- Use parallel structure intentionally, not accidentally
- Vary paragraph length (some short, some longer)

**4. Specificity Requirements:**
- Instead of "many companies" → "companies like X, Y, and Z"
- Instead of "studies show" → "a 2023 study by [researcher] at [institution]"
- Instead of "experts say" → "[Name], [title], explains..."
- Instead of "various factors" → "three key factors: X, Y, and Z"
- Instead of "some people" → "approximately 40% of users" or "early adopters"

**5. Engagement Techniques:**
- Open with a compelling hook (question, surprising fact, vivid scene)
- Use rhetorical questions sparingly (1-2 per article max)
- Include brief, relevant anecdotes
- Create narrative tension or curiosity gaps
- End with actionable insights or thought-provoking conclusions

**6. Professional Tone:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Accessible but not condescending
- Sophisticated but not pretentious
- Authoritative but not dogmatic

### Quality Checklist (Self-Review Before Output)

Before finalizing content, verify:

- [ ] No forbidden phrases appear anywhere
- [ ] Every claim is backed by specifics (examples, data, sources)
- [ ] Sentence beginnings vary throughout
- [ ] Active voice used (90%+ of sentences)
- [ ] Specific examples replace vague generalizations
- [ ] Opening hooks the reader immediately
- [ ] Conclusion provides value (insights, actions, or questions)
- [ ] Natural flow between paragraphs
- [ ] Professional yet human voice maintained
- [ ] Content is clear and precise throughout

### Revision Instructions

If you notice any forbidden patterns:
1. **Replace immediately** with natural alternatives
2. **Add specificity** where vague language exists
3. **Vary sentence structure** if repetitive
4. **Strengthen examples** if abstract
5. **Enhance clarity** if any confusion possible

**Remember:** Quality over speed. Better to take time to write well than to rush and produce generic content.
